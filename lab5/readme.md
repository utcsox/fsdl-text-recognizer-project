# Lab 5: Experimentation

In this lab we will introduce the IAM handwriting dataset, and give you a chance to try out different things, run experiments, and review results on W&B.

## W&B Setup

First, let's set up W&B -- a little differently this time. Run `wandb init` inside of the `lab5` directory. For the team, choose `fsdl`, and for the project, name it `fsdl-text-recognizer-project`.

This will let us all share a project. We'll be able to see all of our runs, including network parameters and performance.


## IAM Dataset

This dataset for handwriting recognition has over 13,000 handwritten lines from 657 different writers.

Let's take a look at what it looks like in `notebooks/03-look-at-iam-lines.ipynb`.

The image width is also 952px, as in our synthetic `EmnistLines` dataset.
The maximum output length is 97 characters, however, vs. our 34 characters.

## Training

Let's train with the default params by running `tasks/train_lstm_line_predictor_on_iam.sh`.
For me, training for 8 epochs gets test set character accuracy of ~40%, and takes about 10 minutes.

Training longer will keep improving: the same settings get to 60% accuracy in 40 epochs: https://app.wandb.ai/sergeyk/fsdl-text-recognizer/runs/a6ucf77m

For the rest of the lab, let's just play around with different things and see if we can improve performance quickly.
